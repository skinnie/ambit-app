# AmbitApp

> Saved here 2026-08-06 as a reference/context document. This describes a separate Qt 6 /
> QML / C++ desktop application ("AmbitApp") with its own existing codebase, distinct from
> the Python reverse-engineering tooling in the rest of this repo (`tools/`) and from the
> React Native `opensportsync` fork referenced in `HANDOFF.md` as the mobile base app. That
> Qt/QML codebase itself is not present in this repo/session - this file is the spec only,
> kept for context if/when that project's work intersects with this one (e.g. the open
> Sport Modes questions in `unresolved_questions_for_devs.md`, or the CustomModes/format
> findings in `custom_modes_andre.md`).

## Mission

AmbitApp is the modern companion application for legacy Suunto Ambit watches.

Its purpose is to preserve and improve the Ambit experience after the official Suunto ecosystem.

AmbitApp is NOT trying to become:

- Garmin Connect
- Suunto App
- Intervals.icu
- Strava

Those platforms already exist.

AmbitApp focuses on the watch.

Everything starts with the watch.

---

# Core Principles

Every feature should respect these principles.

Simple

Reliable

Outdoor

If a feature does not improve one of those three, it probably does not belong in AmbitApp.

---

# Current Project

IMPORTANT

Do NOT rewrite the application.

The current codebase already contains a large amount of working functionality.

Always inspect the existing implementation before creating new code.

Reuse existing code whenever possible.

Refactor only when necessary.

The goal is a modern UI and architecture, not rewriting the backend.

---

# Existing Features

Already implemented

✓ Activity synchronization

✓ Route management

- Import GPX
- Export GPX
- Upload
- Download

✓ POI management

- Coordinates
- GPX Import
- GPX Export
- Upload
- Download

✓ Third-party integrations

- Intervals.icu
- Runalyze
- Strava

These features already work.

Improve the interface.

Do not replace them.

# Future Features

Not implemented yet

Sport Modes

Keep the architecture ready.

Hide the navigation entry using a feature flag.

Example

FeatureFlags::SportModes = false

Once enabled the navigation automatically appears.

No redesign required later.

# Technology

Backend

Existing backend remains.

QML must NEVER directly communicate with libambit.

# Device Capabilities

Never hardcode watch models.

Instead expose capabilities.

Example

supportsRoutes

supportsPOIs

supportsSportModes

supportsApps

supportsNavigation

supportsBluetooth

supportsFirmware

The UI should automatically adapt.

This will allow future support for

Ambit1

Ambit2

Ambit3

Traverse

without redesign.

---

# Theme

Create a reusable theme system.

Never hardcode colors.

Theme.qml

Background

Card

Primary

Secondary

Accent

Success

Warning

Error

Text

MutedText

Support

Light

Dark

Future themes should require zero UI changes.

---

# Icons

Use Material Symbols Rounded.

No emoji.

No platform-specific icons.

---

# Localization

Every visible string must use

qsTr()

No hardcoded English strings.

Prepare for future translations.

English

French

Portuguese

# Navigation

Home

# HOME

The watch is the hero.

Only show ONE watch.

Do not repeat the watch elsewhere.

Use the official Ambit 3 Peak Sapphire images already available inside the Suunto Android resources.

Device card

Watch Image

Watch Name

Connection Status

Battery

Firmware

GPS Orbit validity

Future information may be added without redesigning the card.

Obtain device information from the current backend.

Inspect OpenAmbit/libambit if additional fields are needed.
