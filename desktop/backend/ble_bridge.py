"""Desktop-app side of the Bluetooth bridge - talks to `tools/ble_server.py listen`, the
process that actually holds the watch's BLE (GATT server) connection open.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `server.py`'s other endpoints work by running a CLI tool
(`write_nav.py`, `sgee.py`, ...) as a fresh subprocess per HTTP request, each one opening
its own USB connection and exiting - fine for a cable that's just always there. BLE can't
work that way: the watch's advertising window is short, the GATT server + D-Bus event loop
have to stay running across many commands, and only one process can host that server at a
time. So `ble_server.py` stays a single long-lived daemon (started once, kept running across
many requests) instead of a per-call subprocess, and this module is the thin client that
talks to it over the Unix control socket `ble_server.py`'s `ControlSocketServer` exposes.
Same shape as the Android side of this project: `AmbitBleModule` owns one persistent
connection, and every other call (`AmbitBleDeviceProvider`, in-app `getLogs`/etc.) just
reaches into it - a Unix socket standing in here for that shared in-process state.

LINUX ONLY, for now. `ble_server.py` hosts the GATT server via BlueZ's D-Bus API, which has
no equivalent on macOS or Windows - each of those needs its own peripheral-mode backend
(CoreBluetooth on macOS, WinRT's GATT server APIs on Windows) behind this same client
interface. Nothing here is Linux-specific by construction; only `ble_server.py` itself is.

DRY-RUN BY DEFAULT, matching every other watch-writing path in this project
(`write_nav.py`, `sgee.py`, `server.py`'s own WATCH_LOCK'd endpoints): connecting only reads
(`command()` calls made read-only unless `confirm: true` is threaded through, same contract
`server.py` already uses for USB). `set_dry_run(False)` is the explicit, one-place opt-in.
