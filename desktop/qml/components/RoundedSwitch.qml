// Real request 2026-08-09 ("display dark and storm alarm still have squared buttons") -
// the installed Qt Basic style's own Switch.qml does round its track (radius: 8 on a
// 56x28 shape), but that's a modest corner-round, not a true pill - noticeably squarer
// than everything else in the app now that RoundedButton/RoundedComboBox etc. use much
// more generous rounding. A drop-in replacement for `Switch { ... }` - extends Switch
// directly, so every existing property (checked/enabled/onToggled) keeps working
// unchanged.

    // contrast RoundedSlider's own ~18px handle) - shrunk from 44x24/18px-handle down
    // closer to that same visual scale, rather than Basic style's own default touch-target
    // sizing.

        // an already-dark Theme.card with almost no contrast, so an off switch effectively
        // disappeared. Exactly the same root cause as the "the contour of the buttons when

        // Theme.mutedText borders); this component was simply missed at the time. Fill with
        // Theme.card and give it the same muted border so the pill is always visible.
