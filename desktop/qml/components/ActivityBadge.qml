// The coloured circular badge Sport Modes shows for each mode, with a per-activity symbol.
//
// Real, 2026-08-10 (André: "I see different colors for different sports but all have the
// same icon... suunto link had specific icons for activity type, which was later linked to
// sport mode"). Both the colour and the symbol are keyed on the mode's own `activityId`
// (custom_modes.py already decodes and exposes it, entry 0x213) - never on the English
// mode name, which is free text the owner can rename and which no other language matches.
//
// The activity table itself lives in assets/activity_types.json: 84 activities with their
// real ids, names, Suunto category colours and an SVG body each. Two rendering styles are
// carried in that file:
//   "glyph" (77) - our own drawing, a white symbol laid on the coloured disc
//   "badge"  (7) - a disc-with-symbol-knocked-out taken from Suunto's own icon font, for a
//                  handful whose equipment shapes we could not draw legibly at 22px (see
//                  CREDITS.md). Drawn as a white disc with the glyph filled in the activity
//                  colour on top, so the symbol reads white in either theme.
