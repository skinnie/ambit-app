"""Reads the Suunto Kailash's real on-watch `sml.DeviceHistory` object live - the same data
shown on the watch's own "7R" button screen (visited cities/countries, travel stats) plus, as
a real bonus found in the same reply, the "activity mode" logbook (`LogHeaders`) this project
had separately been unable to locate in flash.

**Real mechanism, confirmed working end to end against real hardware, 2026-08-08**: the
existing `0x1200` object-by-identifier query (`write_nav.py`'s own `CMD_LOG_HEADERS`, already
used there for `sml.DeviceLogBook`, entry `0x8d`) also answers for `sml.DeviceHistory`, entry
`0x67` - found via this exact watch's own real SBEM schema descriptor (`assets/APK/kailash/
Suunto 7R/Container/Documents/descr+79DC39510E000100+2.0.5`, `tools/sbem_schema.py --group
0x67` lists every field). Cross-checked field by field against what the watch's own screen and
the `7R` iOS app's local database (`7r-trackLog.db`, `device_history` table) show for the same
real watch: `NumberOfVisitedPlaces`/`NumberOfVisitedCountries`=1/1 (Lille, France),
`TravellingDays`/`TravelledDistance`/`FurthestFromHome`=0/0/0 - exact match.

Two unit conversions applied here that `sbem_schema.py`'s own `decode_entry()` deliberately
does *not* apply (it only unpacks the raw stored type - the `<MOD>` conversion is documented
in the schema text but is a free-form formula, not something the generic decoder evaluates):
`LogHeaders.Header.Duration` is `raw/10` seconds (confirmed against the schema's own
`<MOD>x/10,y*10`), `Speed.Max` is `raw/360` (`<MOD>x/360,y*360`, unit unconfirmed - m/s is
plausible but not independently checked). `VisitedCities...Location.Longitude/Latitude` are
a real, separate case: plain `float32`, genuinely different from every *other* lat/lon field
in this same schema (all `int32`, degrees*1e7) - decoding them as degrees directly gives
implausible values (~0.05, ~0.88); as **radians** (`value * 180 / pi`), they land exactly on
Lille's real coordinates, confirming the unit even though the descriptor's own `<MOD>` tag for
these two specific fields is empty.

    ./tools/kailash_history.py
    ./tools/kailash_history.py --json   # for ambitapp-v2/backend/server.py, not for a person
    ./tools/kailash_history.py --gps    # also reads sml.DeviceLog - see its own docstring below

**`--gps`, added 2026-08-08, still needs a real cable test**: `sml.DeviceHistory` (this file's
original scope) is one of seven real queryable top-level objects in this watch's own
descriptor (`sbem_schema.py`'s `Schema.queries`, `<QRY>`-tagged entries) - `sml.DeviceLog`,
entry `0x53`, is a sibling, not touched by anything in this project until now. It's exactly
what a real BLE capture of a watch-only "GPS Power Use" recording (7R-button long-press, no
phone) showed being pushed over `0x1200` to the paired phone - see `KAILASH-BLE-FINDINGS.md`
Findings 5-6: a `Header` (Duration/DateTime/Device name+serial) plus a `Samples.Sample` array
(`Latitude`/`Longitude`/`GPSAltitude`/`Time`/`UTC` per point). Real, open question those
findings raise that this flag exists to answer: the BLE-synced sample list ran at a real,
measured ~31-second interval, not the ~1 Hz a decade-old review of this watch's firmware
claims for the recording itself - reading `sml.DeviceLog` **directly off the watch over the
cable**, bypassing the 7R app and its BLE sync entirely, is the way to tell "firmware really
changed" from "the app downsamples before pushing over BLE" apart: if a cable read of the same
just-recorded activity comes back denser than what BLE showed, the app is the one thinning it
out; if it's the same ~31 s spacing, that's what the watch itself is actually recording now.
Also note, matching `write_nav.py`'s own documented caveat for the sibling `logbook` query:
**multi-page replies are not handled here** - a single `0x1200` reply is returned as-is, no
continuation-cursor paging attempted (the real BLE captures needed two separate `0x1200`
messages for a mere 36 samples, so a long recording may come back truncated over cable too;
not yet known whether the cable path's own reply-reassembly in `Link._read_reply()`, which
already spans multiple 64-byte HID reports per command, makes this a non-issue in practice or
not - that's part of what the first real run of this flag will show).
