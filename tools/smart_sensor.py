"""Reads the Suunto Smart Sensor's own identity/status over BLE - manufacturer, model,
serial, hardware/firmware/software revision, battery level, and (if it's being worn) a
live heart rate sample.

This is plain standard BLE GATT - the Device Information Service (0x180A), Battery
Service (0x180F), and Heart Rate Service (0x180D) - not the vendor NSP protocol
`ble_link.py` speaks to the watches. No pairing/auth needed to read most of it, though a
device the OS has never seen at all still needs a normal scan first.

Real, confirmed live 2026-08-13 against an actual Suunto Smart Sensor
(0C:8C:DC:0D:D8:4C): it identifies itself as a **Movesense**-platform sensor
(Manufacturer="Suunto", Model="Movesense", HW="00.D9", FW="6.0077", SW="1.1.0") - the
"Suunto Smart Sensor"/"BlueBelt" name is only Suunto's own branding/device-catalog
codename (`assets/.../devices.xml`), not what the hardware calls itself.

Talks to BlueZ directly via `bluetoothctl`/`busctl` subprocess calls, not bleak -
deliberately: bleak's own `BleakClient.connect()` always re-runs an active discovery scan
to locate the device first (`bleak/backends/bluezdbus/client.py`), which fails for a
device BlueZ already has connected (a connected peripheral stops advertising, so a fresh
scan can't see it) - exactly the common case here, since the belt is usually already
paired/connected from an earlier session. Reading GATT characteristics this way needs no
persistent connection, so a one-shot `busctl call ... ReadValue` per field is fine; heart
rate is the one exception - BlueZ ties a `StartNotify` subscription to the D-Bus
connection that requested it, so that piece alone uses a real persistent connection
(`dbus_fast`, already a bleak dependency) instead of a one-shot subprocess.

    ./tools/smart_sensor.py --status --json
    ./tools/smart_sensor.py --status                  # human-readable

Real gotcha hit live 2026-08-13: heart_rate_bpm came back null through the app every time,
identity/battery fine, while this same file run directly always worked. Cause: identity/
battery only ever shell out to `busctl`/`bluetoothctl`, so they work under any Python, but
the HR listener needs `dbus_fast` in the SAME interpreter that runs this file -
`desktop/backend/server.py`'s `PYTHON = sys.executable` is whatever process happened to
start the backend, not necessarily this repo's own venv. If HR is always null despite good
contact, check `dbus_fast` is installed for that specific interpreter, not just this one.
