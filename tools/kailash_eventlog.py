"""Dumps the Suunto Kailash's `EventLog` flash region and tries decoding it as a flat array
of Ambit3-shaped `WaypointDescriptor` records (the same 52-byte lat/lon/name/route_name/tail
struct this project's own POI and Waypoint tooling already uses) - a real hypothesis, not
confirmed against real bytes yet.

**Why this exists**: `kailash`'s own real `0x0b21` memory-map reply (`assets/ambit3 pcap/v2/
kailash`, decoded 2026-08-08, see `custom_modes_andre.md`'s "Kailash" section) reports a real,
present `EventLog` region (`0x0c3500`, 400,000 bytes) with no Ambit3 equivalent at all - not
Waypoints, not Routes, not ExerciseLog. André's own real-world context: Kailash/Hoopoe belongs
to the same Traverse-generation watch line that started out purely as a places-you've-visited
logger (no export mechanism of its own, no sync) before later watches in that line added real
activity recording - "event" here plausibly means exactly that kind of place/moment marker,
not a structured sport-mode setting the way `EXERCISE_MODES_APP_META`'s events are. Nothing
here has confirmed the record shape yet, though: `WaypointDescriptor` is this project's own
closest real analogue (a real, hardware-verified lat/lon/name struct already used for the
watch's Waypoints/POI region - and notably, Kailash's own memory map places its *Waypoints*
region at the exact same address as Ambit3's, `0x005000`, real evidence the two devices share
at least some struct layouts), not a confirmed EventLog format of its own.

**What this script actually does**: reads the real region byte-for-byte (`0x0b17`, same
generic flash-read mechanism every other region in this project already uses) and walks it as
a flat array of 52-byte records from offset 0 (no assumed header - EventLog's own header shape,
if it has one, is unconfirmed; this is the simplest hypothesis, not the only possible one),
keeping only records whose `lat`/`lon` fall in a real valid range (-900000000..900000000 /
-1800000000..1800000000, i.e. degrees*1e7) and whose decoded name is mostly printable - both
checks needed because `decode_name()` never raises (UTF-8 errors just become the U+FFFD
replacement character), so a genuine format mismatch would otherwise silently produce
plausible-looking-but-fake entries instead of an honest failure. Writes one real GPX `<wpt>`
per record that passes both checks, the same `lat/1e7, lon/1e7` convention every other real
POI/waypoint tool in this project already uses (`decode_route.py`, `build_route.py`).

**Not yet run against a real Kailash** - no such device was connected while this was written.
If the plausibility rate is low or zero, that's real information the format guess above is
wrong, not proof this device has no such data.
