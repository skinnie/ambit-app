"""Dumps the Suunto Kailash's `TrackLog` flash region and decodes it - a real, confirmed
20-byte fixed-stride GPS record format, found 2026-08-08 against real hardware after the
initial hypothesis (reusing Ambit3's own `ExerciseLog` PMEM20 format) was tried and cleanly
falsified (no PMEM magic, implausible master-index numbers - see git history/
`custom_modes_andre.md` for that attempt).

**Real format, confirmed against real hardware AND a real known location, corrected once
already - worth reading, not just trusting the numbers below:** the first pass at this had
every field right except the record boundary, off by exactly one byte. That misalignment
still produced smoothly-varying, plausible-*looking* coordinates (a real, coherent-seeming
track through the Canadian Arctic) - "varies smoothly" alone was not proof of a correct
decode, and it took André pointing out the real location should be Lille, France for the
actual bug (a one-byte record-boundary shift) to surface. Corrected by searching the raw bytes
directly for Lille's own real coordinates (~50.63N, ~3.06E) rather than trusting the earlier
alignment, which is what pinned the true record start.

    record stride: 20 bytes, starting at region offset 1 - the region's own byte 0 is a real,
    currently-unexplained leading byte, not part of any record

    offset  size  field
    0       4     lat, int32 LE, degrees * 1e7 (same convention as this project's own
                   WaypointDescriptor/exercise_log.py samples)
    4       4     lon, int32 LE, degrees * 1e7
    8       4     third field - real values cluster in the low thousands (roughly
                   2,000-9,000 across real records) - unit/meaning not confirmed
                   (accuracy/HDOP is plausible; not cross-checked against another source)
    12      2     year, u16 LE (confirmed: 0x07ea = 2026, matching the real capture date)
    14      1     month
    15      1     day
    16      1     hour
    17      1     minute
    18      2     two more bytes, real values, no clear pattern found yet - reported raw,
                   not asserted (a sub-second/sequence/checksum field is plausible, unconfirmed)

Confirmed against real hardware, 2026-08-08: 56 consecutive real-looking records (index 1-56;
index 0 has a completely different byte shape, unrelated third-field magnitude and an
implausible lat - almost certainly a header/init record, not a GPS fix, and is skipped)
spanning 2026-08-02 through 2026-08-07, coordinates matching André's own real, independently
known location (Lille, France) closely and consistently across every real record - the actual
confirmation, not just "looks smooth." Past record 56 the same fields degrade into implausible
values - the same "real data, then unused flash" pattern already established for Ambit3's own
ExerciseLog, not a bug.

    ("Something is bizarre on the activities, they say no gps, but they have gps") -
    DeviceHistory sessions carry summary stats only (no GPS of their own, see
    kailash_history.py's own docstring), and until now ActivitiesPage.qml filled every
    Kailash "Walk" card's track with an empty placeholder. This is what actually supplies it.

    `s["when"]` is converted from local time to UTC (SESSION_LOCAL_UTC_OFFSET_HOURS, see its
    own comment - a real fix, not the original version of this function, which compared local
    session times directly against UTC TrackLog points and silently matched nothing) before
    comparing against TrackLog's own points.

    A +/-2 minute tolerance is then applied on both ends: TrackLog points are minute-
    resolution and Header.Duration is tenths-of-a-second, two independently-derived clocks
    off the same watch, so exact-window matching would still drop real points to ordinary
    clock/rounding drift between the two sources.

    Always returns exactly one entry per session, in the same order `sessions` came in -
    ActivitiesPage.qml zips this 1:1 against KailashService.sessions by index (both ultimately
    decode the same real wire data in the same order, from two separate backend calls). A
    session with no correlated points gets a real, honest empty track rather than being
    dropped, matching this project's original per-session behaviour for the case where TrackLog
    genuinely doesn't cover it (e.g. a session predating this watch's TrackLog capture start).
    distanceMeters/durationSeconds/startTime always come from the session's own real watch-
    reported stats, not the GPS-derived approximation - only `track`/`gpxText` come from
    TrackLog, since a haversine sum over minute-resolution points is strictly less accurate
    than the watch's own reported values.

    Falls back to one bundled activity covering every point (this project's original,
