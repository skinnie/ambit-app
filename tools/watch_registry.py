"""Persistent registry of Suunto watches this app has seen, keyed by serial.

Why this exists: to flash or recover a watch we need its model codename + hardware version
to fetch the right firmware (firmware_check.py). A watch stuck in the bootloader (BSL) still
reports its SERIAL and hw version, but reports its model as "BSL" - so on its own it cannot
tell us its codename, and we cannot pick the right image. Recording (codename, hw) against
the serial on every normal app-mode connection lets a later BSL recovery look the watch up
by serial and download the correct firmware with no SuuntoLink.

This is the data layer only. The GUI recovery flow that consumes it (auto-identify by
serial, else a "which watch do you want to recover?" picker, else the SuuntoLink message)
is described in FIRMWARE_FLASHER_DESIGN.md.

Storage: a JSON object keyed by serial at $AMBIT_APP_DATA/known_watches.json (default
~/.config/ambit-app/known_watches.json), so it is shared across every tool and the backend.
