"""Device identity (model/serial/firmware/hardware version) and live battery charge.

Not new reverse-engineering - both commands were already known to this project, just never
used this way. `write_nav.py` already sends `CMD_DEVICE_INFO` (0x0000) on every reset/route
run, but discards the reply. `CMD_NAMES` (`ambit_pcap.py`) already names 0x0306 as "status"
from real captures, but nothing here had ever sent it. The actual reply layout for both -
which bytes are model vs. serial vs. version, and that battery charge sits at offset 1 of
the status reply - comes from openambit's own real, working implementation
(`assets/openambit-master.zip`, `libambit.c`'s `device_info_get()` and
`device_driver_common.c`'s `libambit_device_driver_status_get()`), not guessed. Ambit3's own
driver (`device_driver_ambit3.c`) wires `status_get` to exactly that shared implementation,
so this applies to the reference watch, not just older Ambit/Ambit2 models.
