"""Mark a workout as *synced* on the watch - the same per-move flag SuuntoLink writes over
cable so the official Suunto app / SuuntoLink treat the move as already downloaded and don't
duplicate it. Opt-in feature (Settings -> Experimental features, OFF by default): the upside
is no duplicated workouts; the downside is the move can no longer be re-retrieved from the
watch if the Suunto app later fails to keep it. Nothing here deletes anything - the watch
still reclaims log space by circular-buffer wraparound, independent of this flag. See the
`ambit-app-activity-sync-no-delete` finding.

Own file, this project's own "one file per format" convention (importing `Link`/constants
from `write_nav.py`, never growing it into a dispatcher).

USB (PROVEN, byte-exact vs the real SuuntoLink capture `assets/pcap/lars_ambit3peak_
13032017.pcap`): command 0x1201 (`ambit3_log_synced`), one SBEM0102 entry whose id is the
firmware generation's `log_synced_data_id` (0x8b on the Ambit3 GEN4 reference watch), value =
a NUL-terminated 20-byte LOCAL ISO8601 timestamp (the move header's own wall-clock time, not
the UTC-corrected one) + a single `synced=1` byte. Run `./tools/mark_synced.py --verify` to
byte-check the builder against that capture. The generation lookup mirrors openambit's own
`get_ambit3_fw_gen()`/`get_ambit3_driver_params()` tables - and, exactly like openambit, only
GEN4 has a known non-zero id: for every other generation (older Ambit3 fw, Vertical,
Traverse) the id is unknown, so this refuses to write rather than guess a wrong entry id.

BLE (UNVERIFIED): the real Suunto app never wrote this flag in any capture - it uses
`EventBoard` events instead (see `tools/ble_schema.py`). `mark_ble()` sends the *same*
0x1201/`log_synced_data_id` marker over the NSP transport by analogy with USB (the wire body
is identical; only the framing differs), using `write_nav.SBEM_WRITE_PREFIX` - the RE'd
phone-write header the app uses for its other BLE writes. This needs a live-watch check to
confirm it actually sets the shared synced flag; until then it is guarded the same way (GEN4
id only) and clearly logged as experimental.

    ./tools/mark_synced.py --verify          # self-test the builder vs the real capture
    ./tools/mark_synced.py --list            # show the fw-gen -> id table
