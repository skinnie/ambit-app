 * see AmbitBleModule.kt's COMPATIBLE_NAME_PREFIXES and KAILASH-BLE-FINDINGS.md
 * Finding 8; the Kailash has no Routes/POI feature at all though, see
 * KAILASH-SCOPING-NOTE.md — only Sync/Backup make sense for it here).
 * Real-hardware-tested as of 2026-08-09: pairing itself now works
 * (see HANDOFF.md Milestone 7's dated entries that day for the two real bugs
 * found and fixed — an unhandled PAIRING_VARIANT_PASSKEY, and a
 * BLUETOOTH_PRIVILEGED permission wall on setPairingConfirmation()).
 *
 * Deliberately thin: once connected, every other watch operation
 * (writeRoute, readRegion, addPoi, ...) is imported from AmbitUsbModule.ts
 * as usual and works unchanged — they operate on the same native g_device
 * regardless of which transport connected it. Only connection setup is
 * BLE-specific.
