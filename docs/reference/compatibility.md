# Compatibility matrix — what works on which watch

What has been **tested on real hardware**, feature by feature, watch by watch. This is the honest
answer to a user's "will it work on *my* watch?" — and the checklist that gates a release. A cell is
only marked working once André has confirmed a real test on that physical watch (see the test ritual
in `CLAUDE.md`). Anything untested stays `—` and the feature is treated as **Experimental** in-app.

**Legend:** ✅ works (date) · ⚠️ partial (see note) · ❌ broken (see note) · — not tested yet ·
n/a not applicable to that watch

Kailash has **no CustomModes region**, so the sport-mode rows are **n/a** there — mark them n/a once
confirmed. Ambit3 Peak (Emu) is the reference watch.

## How this gets filled
Not by hand in a big sitting — it fills itself through the **test ritual**: after any watch-facing
change, Claude asks "did you test this on Kailash / Ambit3 / Traverse?", you answer yes/no, and the
matching cell is updated here with the date. Over time this becomes your real, evidence-based support
table — and the thing you check before tagging a release.
